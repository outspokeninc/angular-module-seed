## Angular Module Seed

Starting place for an AngularJS module the way that *I* want to build them.

Using these build-time tools:
 * Browserify and watchify
 * Browser-Sync
 * Make
 
NOT using 
* gulp or grunt.  Why? Because at the end of the day it just seems easier


Background Reading/inspiration:

of the universe!)
